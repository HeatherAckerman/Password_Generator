# Password_Generator
I was given html, css, and some beginning js. My goal was to create a password generator that would produce a random password between 8 and 128 characters. I was to use prompts to ask how many characters the password should be, and if the password was to have special characters, numbers, lowercase or uppercase letters.

I developed a list of prompts and tried to push the answers into a new array that the password would be randomly generated from. I unfortunatley did not have enough time to perfect it and get it functional before the due date, but I will continue to try.
